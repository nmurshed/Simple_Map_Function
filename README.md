# Simple_Map_Function


This project aims to develop a multi-threaded simple map utility to find shortest path beween
two places. The shortest path is found by using Dijkstra's algorithm.

The map is implemented in roadmap.c and is provided with a header file
roadmap.h.

Functionalities Supported
The roadmap supports adding: 
- Vertex
- Edge
- Add an Edge Event
- Name a Road between edges
- Lookup for suggestions for Vertex Name in the Map
- Find the shortest distance between two vertex
- Store the map into a file
- Retreive the map from a file previously saved using Store
- Print the Graph Info

Learning
The project aided the group to explore, and learn:
- Dynamic Data Structures in C
- Dijkstra's algorithm using directed weighted graph
- Levenshtein distance
- Development in a *nix Machine (Ubuntu/Mac)
- API in C and use of header file
- Vim Editor
- Makefile
- Bash scripts
- Git
